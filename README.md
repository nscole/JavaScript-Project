As a user, I want to play a trivia game and try to get all the answers correct. 

Itâ€™s a basic trivia game with 10 questions a counter which will tell me the score of how many questions I get right.
It will tell me the topic header such as music, movies etc.
Ask me a question and give either four multiple questions or two true or false questions.

I will have an image at the top which where a mouseover event will happen and the image will change colours. There is multiple click events and at the end when you have answered 10 quests it tells you the final score and gives you the option to play again. 

The api I am using is https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

I expect to face challenges with trying to get the answers to come up with incorrect or correct option. Also trying to reset the game and setting up the counter function.
